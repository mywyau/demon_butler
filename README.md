Service to help manage and run my other app micro-services using docker

At the moment we are containerising our app frontend and backend microservices using docker and docker compose.

We wanted a system to coordinate and run all desired microserice containers easily.

##  Requirements:
    
- A configurable system for Microservices, we should be able to add more microservices as a configuration file to run as a set.
- Must be possible to run in parallel to help speed up processing of building containers
- Must run container app code from a central directory/location on the system. 
- Must be able to close
